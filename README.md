Hi, I'm unascribed, or Una. I've been modding Minecraft for 11 (nearly 12) years. It's horrifying. When I'm not doing that, I run various services and develop various (mostly game-adjacent) software.

Check out my [personal website](https://unascribed.com) for more.

I'm increasingly using my [Forgejo](https://git.sleeping.town) for new projects. I use GitHub to contribute to others' projects and to ease discovery/contribution for community-focused projects.

Noteworthy projects that are hosted here on GitHub, since having a private profile removes the pinned repositories (wtf?):
* **[AsyncSimpleLog](https://github.com/unascribed/AsyncSimpleLog)** - A fast, small, and useful logger implementation for SLF4j. 
* **[FlexVer](https://github.com/unascribed/FlexVer)** - A SemVer-compatible intuitive comparator for free-form versioning strings as seen in the wild, designed to sort versions like people do. 
* **[SymbolicControllerDB](https://github.com/unascribed/SymbolicControllerDB)** - The SDL controller DB is how controllers behave. What if we had a database of how they look? 
* **[unbted](https://github.com/unascribed/unbted)** - Una's NBT Editor - an advanced interactive command-line NBT editor

Noteworthy projects that are mirrored here, but are primarily on Forgejo:
* **[NilLoader](https://github.com/unascribed/NilLoader)** - The universally-compatible ultra-light mod loader.
* **[Ears](https://github.com/unascribed/Ears)** - Faithful fancy fashion features for fuzzy folk.
* **[Partyflow](https://github.com/unascribed/Partyflow)** - A self-hosted media transcoding service and release manager styled around Bandcamp.

Noteworthy stuff I helped with:
* **[the Fractureiser malware investigation](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser)**
* **[Voldeloom](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom)** - A modern Gradle plugin for old versions of Forge (quat has since entirely rewritten it)
