Hi, I'm unascribed, or Una. I've been modding Minecraft for 11 (nearly 12) years. It's horrifying. When I'm not doing that, I run various services and develop various (mostly game-adjacent) software.

Check out my [personal website](https://unascribed.com) for more, including a listing of notable projects.

I'm increasingly using my [Gitea](https://git.sleeping.town) for new projects; I use GitHub to contribute to others' projects and to ease discovery/contribution for community-focused projects, like [FlexVer](https://github.com/unascribed/FlexVer) and [SymbolicControllerDB](https://github.com/unascribed/SymbolicControllerDB).
