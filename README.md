Hi, I'm unascribed, or Una. I've been modding Minecraft for 11 (nearly 12) years. It's horrifying. When I'm not doing that, I run various services and develop various (mostly game-adjacent) software.

I use GitHub to promote projects and as a home for stuff I haven't gotten around to (or do not care enough to) migrate to my [Gitea](https://git.sleeping.town/unascribed), which is where all of my new projects are going. Eventually I may completely migrate all of my repositories over there.
